        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! I'm Dan, a passionate 17-year-old who loves programming in Python and JavaScript. I find joy in crafting captivating front-end websites that not only look good but also provide seamless user experiences. 
          As I continuously strive to improve my skills in graphics design, I believe in blending aesthetics with functionality to create visually stunning web projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding and design, you might find me answering questions on Quora â€“ that's my go-to pastime when I'm looking for some mental stimulation. It's fascinating to share knowledge and insights with the Quora community, especially when I'm in need of a little break from coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you can often catch me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, or working on personal projects. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and pushing my creative boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in collaborating on exciting projects or simply want to connect, feel free to drop me a message. Let's bring our ideas to life together!
