### Description

Tickets is a bot that allows you to create and manage ticket channels in Discord. It's a free and open-source alternative to popular ticketing bots like Ticket Tool, TicketsBot, Tickety, Helper.gg, Helper, and others' paid "premium" and "white-label" plans.

Discord Tickets has a lot more features and customization options than many of the bots described above. The bot can have your community/logo company's for free because it is designed for self-hosting.

Although designed for usage in a single Discord server, the bot can be used in numerous servers at the same time if you manage multiple communities.
