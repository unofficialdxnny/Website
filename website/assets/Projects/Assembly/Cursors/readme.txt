Author's description:

Cursors I thought were cool & thought, hey why aren't these on RealWorld graphics, & that's why I decide to upload these. (BTW these were NOT made by me, but made by Glimy on Dribbble. Link: https://dribbble.com/shots/3260909-Chroma-Cursors-for-Windows )  My discord also: eeveelover64#0228
